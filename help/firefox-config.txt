    Create a new text file, somewhere like your Desktop or home folder named, autoconfig.cfg.
    Enter these lines into that file:

Updated May 16 2020 for Firefox 76. The new browser version broke the older code. This works well for me now.

// first line is a comment
var {classes:Cc,interfaces:Ci,utils:Cu} = Components;
try {
  Cu.import("resource:///modules/AboutNewTab.jsm");
  var newTabURL = "file:///C:/Users/yourname/yourfile.html";
  AboutNewTab.newTabURL = newTabURL;
} catch(e){Cu.reportError(e);} // report errors in the Browser Console

    Replace “file:///C:/Users/yourname/yourfile.html” with the actual path to your file, something like “file:///homepage.html”, for example.
    Save that file and then copy it into the root of the Firefox program folder.
    Create a new text file named autoconfig.js.
    Enter these lines into that file:

//
pref("general.config.filename", "autoconfig.cfg");
pref("general.config.obscure_value", 0);
pref("general.config.sandbox_enabled", false);

    Save that file and then copy it into the defaults/pref folder under ther Firefox program folder.
    Disable any tab-related extensions which might change the intended behavior here.
    Restart Firefox.
